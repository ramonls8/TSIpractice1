# DGIIM TSI Practice 1

Practice 1 of the TÃ©cnicas de los Sistemas Inteligentes course in the Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Granada. This project is based on the GVGAI environment.

The objective of this practice is to guide the agent to the goal using the Dijkstra, A*, RTA* and LRTA* algorithms. In order to pass through the blue walls, the agent needs to collect a blue cape, and a red cape for the red walls.
